# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# User.create(first_name: "NY", last_name: "Admin", email: "admin@test.com", birthdate: "19900313", is_admin: true, username: "Admin", password: "password");
# User.create(first_name: "David", last_name: "Patlut", email: "david@david.com", birthdate: "19920408", is_admin: false, username: "dpatlut", password: "password");
